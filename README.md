## Installing and starting the app

First, you have to install all dependencies using the `npm` command. The application consists of a frontend part and backend API. We implement backend API, so we don't expose `Authenteq API key`. Backend is using `Authenteq API key` along with `Authenteq PartnerID` to query Authenteq service.

### `npm install`

Then, you can start the client server.

### `npm run start`

And in separate terminal, start backend api server:

### `npm run server`

Server API will be running and http://localhost:3001 and frontend will run on
http://localhost:3000.
